# DDC
A data-driven approach for constructing mutation categories for mutational signature analysis

DDR_genes.npy includes a list of DNA damage repair genes from https://www.mdanderson.org/documents/Labs/Wood-Laboratory/human-dna-repair-genes.html
The two mutation opportunity python dictionaries are of {'7-mer sequence': occurrences} - one for GRCh37 genome and the other for GRCh37 exome.
